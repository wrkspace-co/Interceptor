# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Being respectful and considerate.
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment or discrimination in any form.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the maintainers through the repository's preferred contact channel (for example, a private security advisory or a maintainer email listed in `SECURITY.md`). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1.
