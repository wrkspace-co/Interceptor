# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Security fixes are applied to the latest `main` branch. We do not currently maintain backports for older releases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.

Preferred reporting method:
- Use GitHub Security Advisories (if the repository is hosted on GitHub).

If Security Advisories are not available:
- Contact the maintainers through a private channel listed in the repository (for example, an email address in `README.md` or a maintainer profile).

We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and provide an ETA for a fix after triage.
